Character selector screen with vintage Mortal Kombat theme design

Just for fun: MORTAL KOMBAT SELECT CHARACTER UI

The UI mock character selector screen is designed to imitate the menu from the classic 90s video game, Mortal Kombat. The interface includes all of the characters from the game and is set up in a grid layout, with each character represented by an image with its name on it.

When the mouse cursor is hovered over a character, the cursor will change to a green frame that blinks and follows the cursor. This green frame highlights the selected character and makes it easy for the user to identify which character they are selecting.
When a character is clicked on, a bio for that character will appear below the grid. This bio includes information about the character's background, special moves, and fighting style.

In addition to selecting characters manually, the user can also click on the "Select Fighter Randomly" button to generate a random character bio. This feature is useful for users who want to learn more about different characters in the game or for those who want to play a quick round of Mortal Kombat with a randomly selected character â€“ Wish this last part was possible XD.
The UI is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear and legible text and pixelated images of the characters to match the style of the era. It was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Overall, this UI is an excellent replica of the Mortal Kombat character selector screen and provides a fun and interactive way for fans of the game to learn more about the characters.
